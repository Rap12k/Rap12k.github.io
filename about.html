                            Hi there, I'm Robert. I am Currently attending the University of the Bahamas 
                            and am in my third year of majoring in Computer Information Systems: Networking. 
                            I have always been fascinated with taking things apart and seeing how they work 
                            and as such became very much interested in technology. Acting on that interest I 
                            have learned and continue to keep abreast with not only programming languages and
                            technology but also the implications toward society as a whole.
                        </p>
                        <p class="detail-text">
                            In addition to technology languages also interest me. This has led me to learn
                            other languages when I am not reading up on technologies or programming. I can
                            both speak and write Spanish at an Intermediate level as well as express my opinions
                            on a variety of topics. I am currently learning Japanese at the moment<br>
                            ( 私は日本語を勉強しています。). After becoming more familiar with 
                            the language I plan to hopefully learn more languages in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p class="detail-text">
                            That's just a little about me. Feel free to reach out to me through the <a href="contact.html" class="about-link">
